## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Minor vanilla JS

### Lingering issues

- Could not get the custom li markers to align vertically with their associated text lines. Could not find a working combo using ::after or ::marker, commented out in main.css.
- Did not put in enough time to more fully build the form validation, relying on client-side required field to throw browser-level errors.
